                <h3>
                    Enterprise Data Platform: Every CDO’s Priority
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Data Fabric. Digital Thread. Data Mesh. Golden Record of Truth. Whatever you call it, a harmonized
                    and
                    usable enterprise data layer is an essential facet of digital transformation. Data fabric
                    facilitates
                    data access across the enterprise in a unified manner with ability to scale. It is not just a matter
                    of
                    automating workflows and processes but also a question of how we bring together legacy and other
                    siloed
                    data systems, to interact with one another and make a unified data platform. It is – with an
                    integrated
                    set of technologies and services, designed to deliver integrated and enriched data – at the right
                    time,
                    in the right method, and to the right data consumer – in support of both operational and analytical
                    workloads.

                <h3>How to Tackle Today’s Enterprise Data Fabric Challenges & Risks</h3>
                <p>As organizations seek to leverage their data, they encounter challenges resulting from disparate and
                    legacy data sources, types, structured and unstructured data, data volume, and data quality.
                    Code-intensive platforms require deep technical skill sets and high maintenance. IT teams get caught
                    in
                    an endless loop of training, migrations, updates, and re-training, as they attempt to keep pace with
                    the
                    ever-evolving technology stack, taking time away from creating business value. This
                    multi-dimensional
                    data is further complicated when organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. For many
                    enterprises today, operational data largely remains siloed and hidden, leading to an enormous amount
                    of
                    untapped business insights. Thus, technology agnostic and no-code solutions that encompass the
                    entire
                    data engineering, data science, and DataOps and analytics lifecycle – like Advana – are recommended.

                <h3>Top 3 Data Platform Features</h3>
                <p>Critical, non-negotiable features of an enterprise data platform include centralized and automated
                    data
                    governance that is abstracted away from the code in a metadata layer, hundreds of common data
                    transformations out of the box, and drag and drop analytical models to embed into data pipelines. -
                    Data
                    Governance – Data quality rules and business rules are managed centrally, and referenced in
                    pipelines,
                    for a single point of updation and to ensure updation across the business. Master metadata
                    management to
                    consolidate and standardize data with common definitions and hierarchies to standardize reporting
                    across
                    the business and ensure there is summary data for enterprise-defined KPIs all the way down to
                    detailed
                    transactional data. - Data Engineering – Data ingestion of structured and unstructured data files of
                    various formats from on-prem and cloud storage locations. Out-of-the-box data engineering
                    capabilities
                    like change data capture. Continuous data integration and delivery acceleration through DataOps. -
                    Data
                    Science – ML and AI models predictive and prescriptive models can add value to data by answering
                    specific business questions.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Fabric Consumption</h3>
                <p>Data only delivers business value when it is contextualized and becomes accessible by any user or
                    application in the organization. When implemented correctly, a data fabric helps ensure those values
                    are available throughout the organization in the most efficient and automated way possible. - Data
                    Catalog – Centralized, a golden record of data, the single source of truth for enterprise data
                    consumption, serving as a data dictionary to enable efficient access and reuse of data from
                    business, and easy access to view metadata via data catalog. - Data as a Service – Inside the data
                    fabric, microservices help applications achieve the task of connecting to particular data subject
                    areas in the data fabric. APIs are available for IT teams to connect to and consume data from. -
                    Analytics Catalog – Repository of all analytical models to enable reuse and accelerated insights by
                    enabling ML mode sharing across the organization. - Intelligent Apps – Applications with embedded AI
                    to provide timely insights into business operational workflows to get the right insights, at the
                    right time, to the right user, who can use the information to make a fast better decision.
